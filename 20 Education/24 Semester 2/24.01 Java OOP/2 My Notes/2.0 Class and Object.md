## Class
• Class is a “blueprint” for creating objects
• **Object is an instantiation of class**
• An object has attributes and methods
• Attribute is a variable that keeps the data of a specific object
• Class/Object attributes are fields. i.e: name, age, ...
- We only refer to an OBJECT's attribute, not class attributes (unless its static). (see line 8)
• Methods are the class functions
• Method is a collection of commands for executing action with a common idea

```java title:Class
// Person class:
public class Person {
	public String name = "David";
	public int age = 25;
}
// Create object/instance from a class:
Person p1 = new Person();
System.out.println(p1.name); => David // Refer to the OBJECT's 'name' attribute
System.out.println(p1.age); => 25

// Create several objects from a class
public class CreateSeveralPersons {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Person p1 = new Person();
		Person p2 = new Person();
		p2.name = "Mor";
		p2.age = 23;
		
		System.out.println(p1.name); => David
		System.out.println(p1.age); => 25
		
		System.out.println(p2.name); => Mor
		System.out.println(p2.age); => 23
	}
}
```
### Difference between Method and Function
Function is independent, Method is part of a class.
## Access Modifiers
• Access modifier is used to set the access level for classes, attributes and methods
##### Classes
• public - The class is accessible by any other class
• Default - The class is only accessible by classes in the same package
##### Methods, Attributes
• public - The code is accessible by any other class
• private - The code is accessible within declared class
• Default - **protected**. The code is only accessible by classes in the same package
## Non-Access Modifiers
##### Classes
• final - The class cannot be inherited by other classes (THIS CLASS IS THE BOTTOM/END OF THE TREE)
• abstract - The class cannot be used to create objects
##### Methods, Attributes
• final - cannot be overridden/modified
• **static - belongs to the class**, rather than the object
• abstract - used in an abstract class and can only be used on methods
*Less relevant to this course:*
• Transient - methods and attribute are skipped when serializing the object containing them
• Synchronized - method can only be accessed by one thread at a time
• volatile - The value of a attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
## Getters and Setters (Get and Set)
• By default, all class attributes will have private access modifier
• Create methods to attribute data access
• All class attributes have initial default values

> [!important]
> 1. All attributes in a class will be private by default.
> 2. We will not create Getters/Setters for all attributes.
> 3. Every class in Java has a father class (the 'Object' class)

##### Get
• Get an attribute's value: `{java icon title:} Function get <attributeName>`
> [!attention]
> Be aware – never return reference of attribute of OBJECT type
##### Set
• Set value to an attribute: `{java icon title:} Function set <attributeName>`
• Check attribute data validation
> [!attention]
> Be aware – never set reference to attribute of OBJECT type

When looking for a function/method, we look for its type and then go to its original class.
