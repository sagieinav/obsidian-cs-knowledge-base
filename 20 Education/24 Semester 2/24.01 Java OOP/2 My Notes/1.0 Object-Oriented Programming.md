## Object
We create a blueprint for an object by creating a class.
An object has attributes and methods.
#### Attributes
What an object has
#### Methods
What an object can do
## 4 Pillars of OOP
### 1. Encapsulation
We put all our parameters into the object, like inserting everything into a capsule.
##### Motivation / Pros
- A code with fewer parameters
- Reduce complexity
- Increase reusability
### 2. Abstraction
##### Motivation / Pros
- Simpler interface
- Reduce/isolate the impact of changes
### 3. Inheritance
##### Motivation / Pros
- Allows to eliminate redundant (מיותר) code.
This way we don't need to write some lines of code over and over again,
because we define them once in our object (like creating a blueprint), and then we can have other/new objects we create, inherit the properties/methods we need.
### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means 'many forms'.
##### Motivation / Pros
- Allows to eliminate long statements
- Refactor ugly switch/case statements.

Java file = Class
Function = Method
In OOP, we use a java class as a template/blueprint for an object
