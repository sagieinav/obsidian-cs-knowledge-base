## 1 `==`
Shallowest comparison. Only compares the address. Content doesn't matter, **nor the type**.
> [!example] **Example**
> `Worker w = new Worker();`
> `Person p = w`
> Here, `p` and `w` both point the same address, but they're of different types.
> `==` comparison will treat them as **equal**, because they point to the same address.
