## 4 Getting Started
To run the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:
### 4.1 Prerequisites

*   A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL).
*   The `bash` shell installed (usually the default).
*   `git` command-line tool installed.
### 4.2 Cloning the Repository
1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Clone the private repository using the SSH or HTTPS URL provided by GitHub. You will likely need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password when prompted, if you are using HTTPS.
       ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edu-bash-basics.git
    ```
*(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username).*
3.  Navigate into the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd edu-bash-basics
    ```
### 4.3 Making Scripts Executable
Before running any script, you need to grant execute permissions.
You can do this individually or for all `.sh` files in a directory.
1. Navigate into the `scripts/` directory.
2. Grant execute permissions:
    *   For a single script (e.g., `hello_world.sh` in the `01-basics` directory):
      `chmod +x hello_world.sh`
    *   For all scripts in a directory (e.g., `01-basics`):
      `chmod +x *.sh`
## 5 How to Run Each Script
Navigate to the `scripts/` directory (`cd scripts/`) before attempting to run any script using `./script_name.sh`.
