## Permissions
r - read
w - write
x - execute
#### 1. First letter: object type
'd' - directory
'-' - file
'l' - link
#### 2. First 3 letters - permissions of current user
read / write / execute
#### 3. Next 3 letters - permissions of the group of current user
read / write / execute
#### 4. Last 3 letters - permissions of everyone else
read / write / execute

### Change permissions
"change mod" command. Goes by binary digits (1-7), for every group of 3 letters. This is the order:
r - w - x
example:
1 - 1 - 1 = 7 in binary = rwx
1 - 1 - 0 = 6 in binary = rw
1 - 0 - 0 = 4 in binary = r

`{icon title:RWX_RWX_RWX} chmod 777 file`
`{icon title:RWX_RW_R} chmod 764 file`
`{icon title:add_execute_permissions_to_everyone} chmod +x file`
`{icon title:remove_execute_permissions_to_everyone} chmod -x file`

> [!note]
>  When we have permission to run a file, it will be colored in the terminal (usually in green)

./script_name.sh
./script1.sh
##### Print output
echo "Hello World!"
##### Define and print a variable
x=5
print $x
##### Get user input

read y
##### Condition
___

	echo "It is something!"
else
	echo "It is something else!"

___
```bash title:ForLoop
# Classic for:
for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do
