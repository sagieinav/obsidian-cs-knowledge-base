## 1 What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that enables developers and IT professionals to build, ship, and run applications uniformly and consistently using **Containers**. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package everything an application needs to run: code, libraries, system tools, runtime, and settings.

### 1.1 Key Benefits of Docker

*   **Environment Consistency:** Solves the "it works on my machine" problem. The container includes all dependencies, ensuring the application runs the same way in every environment - development, testing, production.
*   **Portability:** Containers can be easily moved between different environments, whether it's a local computer, server, private cloud, or public cloud.
*   **Efficiency:** Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them lighter and more efficient than Virtual Machines (VMs) which require a full OS for each.
*   **Faster Deployment:** Containers build quickly and can be deployed rapidly, enabling faster development and deployment cycles.
*   **Isolation:** Each container is isolated from others and the host system, increasing security and preventing conflicts between different applications.

### 1.2 Basic Concepts in Docker

*   **Dockerfile:** A text file containing a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It describes the application's environment and the steps to build it.
*   **Image:** A template for a container. It is static and immutable after building. An image is created from a Dockerfile.
*   **Container:** A running instance of an image. It is what actually happens when the image is executed. Multiple containers can be created from the same image.
*   **Docker Hub / Registry:** A central (or private) repository for Docker images. Images can be pushed to and pulled from the registry.

### 1.3 Quick Comparison: Docker vs. Virtual Machines

| Feature              | Docker Containers       | Virtual Machines (VMs)      |
|:-------------------- |:----------------------- |:--------------------------- |
| **Operating System** | Share the host's kernel | Each VM has its own full OS |
| **Size**             | Small (MB)              | Large (GB)                  |
| **Boot Time**        | Seconds                 | Minutes                     |
| **Resource Usage**   | Low                     | High                        |
| **Isolation**        | Process level           | Hardware level (complete)   |

==Ultimately, Docker simplifies application lifecycle management by providing a consistent and isolated environment, making it an essential tool in the modern development and **DevOps** world.==

### 1.4 YAML and Docker
The primary relationship between YAML and Docker is through **Docker Compose**.

==Here's the breakdown:==

1. **Docker Compose:** This is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Instead of running each container individually with `docker run` commands (which can get complex for applications with many interconnected services like a web server, a database, a cache, etc.), you define the entire application's services, networks, and volumes in a single file.
2.  **YAML as the Configuration Format:** The format used for this configuration file in Docker Compose is **YAML**. The default filename is typically `docker-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml`.

So, you use YAML to write the instructions (the configuration) for Docker Compose, and Docker Compose then reads this YAML file to orchestrate your multiple Docker containers.

**In short:** YAML is the language used by Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.

**Simple example of a `docker-compose.yaml` file:**

```yaml
version: '3.8' # Specifies the Docker Compose file format version

services: # Defines the services (containers) that make up your application
  web: # Name of the first service
    image: nginx:latest # The Docker image to use for this service
    ports:
      - "80:80" # Maps port 80 on the host to port 80 on the container
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html # Mounts a local directory into the container
  
  db: # Name of the second service (e.g., a database)
    image: postgres:13 # The Docker image for the database
    environment: # Environment variables for the database container
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Persists database data

volumes: # Defines named volumes for data persistence
  db_data:
```

This YAML file tells Docker Compose to set up two services (`web` and `db`), specifying their images, ports, volumes, and environment variables. You would then simply run `docker compose up` (or `docker-compose up` depending on your Docker version) in the same directory as this file, and Docker Compose would build and start these containers according to the definition in the YAML file.

### 1.5 dockerfile: Example
##### Step 1: Creating the dockerfile
```bash title:dockerfile
# docker file for Flask API:
FROM python:3.13-slim

WORKDIR /app # Create a work directory inside the container

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV PORT=8088 \
	DB_CONNECTION_STRING=featuretoggle.rzbemle.mongodb.net \
	DB_NAME=FeatureToggle \
	DB_USERNAME=sagie \
	DB_PASSWORD={pass_here} \
	FLASK_APP=app.py \
	FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0 \

EXPOSE ${PORT}

CMD ["flask", "run"]
CMD ["python", "run", ${FLAS

```
##### Step 2: Building the docker using the dockerfile from terminal
```bash title:build_docker
touch dockerfile
nano dockerfile
docker build -t flask-feature-toggle .
```
##### Step 3: Checking my docker images
`{bash title:check_docker_images} docker image ls`
##### Step 4: Get the docker up and running
```
docker run -p 8088:8088 flask-feature-toggle
```

## 2 Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Semantic Versioning is a widely adopted standard for versioning software. It provides a clear and consistent way to communicate the *type* of changes in a release to users and developers.

### 2.1 Version Structure

A version number follows the format: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

*   **MAJOR:** Incremented for **breaking changes**. These are changes that are incompatible with previous versions (e.g., requires users to modify their code).
*   **MINOR:** Incremented for **new features** that are **backwards-compatible**. Existing code should still work with the new version.
*   **PATCH:** Incremented for **backwards-compatible bug fixes**.

### 2.2 Key Points

*   The goal is to inform users immediately about the nature of changes just by looking at the version number.
*   `MAJOR` is the most significant change indicator.
*   `MINOR` indicates additive functionality without breaking existing usage.
*   `PATCH` indicates only fixes to existing functionality.
*   Versions can also include optional labels for pre-releases (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha`) or build metadata (e.g., `1.0.0+build123`).
*   Adopting SemVer helps manage dependencies effectively and avoid unexpected issues when updating software.
### 2.3 Guidelines

1.  **Initial Development (0.x.y):** Before your initial release (1.0.0), you can start with `0.1.0` and increment the minor and patch versions as needed. However, be aware that anything in the `0.x.y` range is considered unstable, and breaking changes can happen in minor releases.
2.  **First Release (1.0.0):** Once you have a stable API that users can depend on, release it as `1.0.0`.
3.  **Backward Compatibility:** Always strive to maintain backward compatibility within MINOR and PATCH releases. Breaking changes should trigger a MAJOR version increment.
4.  **Public API:** Semantic Versioning is all about the public API of your software. This is what users of your software interact with. Changes to internal implementation that don't affect the public API do not require a version change according to SemVer, although you might still increment the patch version for bug fixes or minor changes.
5.  **Pre-release Versions:** You can use hyphens to denote pre-release versions (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta.1`). These are unstable and may not meet the requirements of the associated normal version.
6. **Release Candidate**: `-rc` versions are release candidates. These get published when a stable release is close.
7.  **Build Metadata:** You can use plus signs to denote build metadata (e.g., `1.0.0+20130313144700`). This is ignored when determining version precedence.
8.  **Version Precedence:** Versions are compared from left to right (MAJOR, then MINOR, then PATCH). Pre-release versions have lower precedence than normal versions. Build metadata does not affect precedence.

By following these guidelines, you provide clear communication to users of your software about the nature of changes in each release, helping them manage dependencies and updates effectively.
