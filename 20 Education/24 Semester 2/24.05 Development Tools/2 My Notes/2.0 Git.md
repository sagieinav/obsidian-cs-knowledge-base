## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 What is Version Control?

Version control is a system for tracking changes to files over time.  It allows you to:

* Revert to previous versions if needed.
* Collaborate effectively with others on projects.
* Manage code releases more efficiently.
### 1.2 What is Git?
- GIT is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) that tracks versions of files.
- Git records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- It allows individuals and teams to track changes to code and documents.
- Allows for coordinate work among multiple people.
- Revert to previous stages in a project.
### 1.3 Why Use Git?
**Git is a popular choice for version control due to its:**
* Wide adoption among software developers.
* Ease of learning and use.
* Distributed and decentralized nature (allowing offline work and multiple repositories).
* Open-source and free availability.
### 1.4 Cloud-based GIT Services
• GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc... are cloud-based services that host git repositories on remote servers.
• Using any of the mentioned platforms above, allows team members to share and distribute code more efficiently, offering a user-friendly interface for forking or cloning repositories directly to their local machines.
**• By pushing your repositories to any of the above, you will pretty much automatically create your own developer portfolio as well!**
## 2 Basic Concepts
### 2.1 Repository
• A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project.
• Git repositories allow you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.
• Git repositories are the heart of the Git system, containing all the project files and the historical record of changes over time.
• Git repositories can be local or remote.
#### 2.1.1 Remote Repository
repositories that are stored on the internet/network.
### 2.2 Commit
• A commit in Git is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like a snapshot of your entire repository at a particular point In time.
• Each commit contains a snapshot of your files at a specific point in time. This allows you to recall, revert, or compare the state of your project at any past commit.
• Every commit is given a unique identifier.
### 2.3 Branch
• Branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.
• The default branch is called master or main.
• When you make a commit, you're making it on a particular branch.
• Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
## 3 Basic Commands
#### 3.1.1 git init
• **Purpose:** To initialize a new Git repository or reinitialize an existing one. It creates a new .git subdirectory in your project, which houses all necessary repository files - a skeletal repository.
• **Usage:** Running this command in your project's directory will start version control for that project.
• **Explanation:** When starting a new project or wanting to bring an existing project under version control, git init sets up the necessary Git metadata and structures. It creates a new branch (default is master or main) and prepares the project to track changes.

#### 3.1.2 git add
• **Purpose:** Stages changes to be included in the next commit.
• Usage: `{icon title:add_file} git add <file>` or `{icon title:add_all_changes} git add .`
• **Explanation:** 'adding' doesn't change the repository yet but prepares changes for the next commit.
• **Visual:** ![[SS 28032025 at 19.19.27.png]]
#### 3.1.3 git status
• **Purpose:** To display the state of the working directory and the staging area, showing you which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
• **Usage:** `{icon title:} git status`
This command provides a report detailing the state of new files, modified files, and files that are staged for commit.
**Explanation**: `{icon title:} git status` is a critical tool for developers to understand what's happening in their working directory and what changes are ready to be committed. It helps in managing the staging area and gives feedback on the current branch and the status of files.

#### 3.1.4 git commit
• **Purpose:** Save staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
• **Usage:** `{java title:} git commit -m "Commit message"`
• **Explanation:** Each commit is a snapshot of the current project state, which can be revisited later.
• **Visual:** ![[SS 28032025 at 19.23.59.png]]
#### 3.1.5 git push
• **Purpose:** Uploads local branch commits to the remote repository branch.
• **Usage:** `{icon title:} git push <remote> <branch-name>`
• **Explanation:** `{icon title:} git push` synchronizes the local and remote repositories.
• **Visual:** ![[SS 28032025 at 19.26.08.png]]
#### 3.1.6 git pull
• **Purpose:** Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
• **Usage:** `{icon title:} git pull <remote>`
• **Explanation:** Discuss the merging aspect of pulling and how it integrates remote changes.
• **Visual:** ![[SS 28032025 at 19.27.16.png]]
#### 3.1.7 git clone
• **Purpose:** To make a complete copy of an existing repository, including all the history and branches, into a new directory on your local machine.
• **Usage:** `{icon title:} git clone < repository-url>`
This command creates a local version of the repository, including all files, history, and branches.
• **Explanation:** Cloning is typically used when you want to get a local copy of a remote repository to start working on it. It sets up a connection with the original repository, making it easy to pull updates and push changes.

#### 3.1.8 Other Linux commands
- `{icon title:} pwd` - Displays current folder (**p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory)
- `{icon title:}ls, ls -l` - Lists all unhidden files/folders in current dir
- `{icon title:}ls -la` - Lists all files/folders, including hidden ones
- `{icon title:}mkdir <dir_name>` - Create a directory
- `{icon title:}cd <dir_name>` - Change the path to a specified directory
- `{icon title:}nano <file_name>` - Create a new file
- `{icon title:}cat <file_name>` - Display a file
## 4 Out There (Industry Standards)
### 4.1 Working with a remote repository
• Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or network somewhere.
• They can be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or on a private server.
• They function as a central place where multiple developers can push to and pull from.
### 4.2 Collaboration
• **Forking** - Forking is creating your own copy of someone else's project. It's a feature available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. **It's not a direct feature of Git itself.**
• **Pull Requests** - A pull request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to an open-source project. It's a request for the original repository's maintainer to "pull" your work into their repository.
• **Merging** - Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another.
### 4.3 Best Practices
• **Make clear commit messages** - Clear commit messages make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the purpose of changes immediately.
• **Frequent Commits** - Small, frequent commits make it easier to isolate problems when something goes wrong.
• **Branching Strategy** - A clear branching strategy helps in organizing and managing development, ensuring that the project's codebase remains stable and deployable.
• **.gitignore files** - specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, typically used for ignoring files such as compiled code, log files, or local configuration files that don't need to be shared with other collaborators.
[Example: GitHub's gitignore collection](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
## 5 GitHub as a Portfolio
• README.md files:
• Special Git repositories:
• `<username> repo (Example: Tom Cohen, TomCo2210)`
• `<username>.github.io repo (Examples: github.io, repo)`
• PRs, Issues, and Open-Source projects.
