## 3 Getting Started
   
Make sure you have the following software installed:
   
   *   **Git:** Required to clone the repository.
       *   [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   *   **Obsidian:** The knowledge base is designed for use with Obsidian.
       *   [Install Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)
   
**You can use this vault in two primary ways**, depending on whether you want to regularly receive the latest updates from this repository.
   - **Option 1:** Clone and Sync with Updates (keep getting my updates)
   - **Option 2:** Forking the repository (clone and continue on your own)
For instructions on how to set-up and use this vault for your specific needs, please refer to one of the two sections below.
   
### 3.1 Option 1: Clone and Sync with Updates (Recommended for Collaboration)
   
This option is best if you want to **make your own additions and modifications to the vault while also being able to easily pull the latest notes and updates that I add**. This method treats this repository as an "upstream" source for shared notes.

##### Setting Up
1.  **Clone the repository:**
	Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
	   `git clone <your_forked_repo_url> <destination-folder>`
	   `cd <destination-folder>`
	Replace `<destination-folder>` with your desired path.
	
2.  **Add the original repository as an 'upstream' remote:**
	This step only needs to be done once after cloning. It sets up a reference to pull my updates.
	`git remote add upstream https://github.com/sagieinav/obsidian-cs-knowledge-base.git`
   
3.  **Open the Vault in Obsidian:**
	Launch Obsidian, click "Open folder as vault", and select the `<destination-folder>`. You may need to enable community plugins.
   
4.  **Make your own notes and modifications:**
	Use the vault in Obsidian as you normally would, adding or changing notes.

##### Using and Getting Latest Updates
Perform these steps every time you wanna fetch my latest updates and merge them with your current vault.
*BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS WHEN PERFOMING THESE STEPS, TO AVOID POTENTIAL DATA LOSS.*
   
5.  **Commit your changes:**
	Save your changes to your local Git history.
       `git add . # Stages all changes in the vault`
       `git commit -m "Add my personal notes and adjustments" # Use a descriptive message`
	*Always commit your local changes before pulling updates from upstream to avoid losing work and simplify conflict resolution.*
   
6.  **Get the latest updates from the original repository:**
	 When there are updates, fetch them:
       `git fetch upstream`
   
7.  **Merge the updates into your vault:**
    Integrate my fetched updates into your local branch.
       `git merge upstream/main # Assuming 'main' is the default branch name`

 *   If Git reports **merge conflicts**, you'll need to manually edit the affected files to resolve them, then stage (`git add <conflicted_file>`), and complete the merge (`git merge --continue`).
   
   
   By following steps 5 through 7 periodically, you can keep your personalized vault updated with the latest shared notes while preserving your own modifications.
   
### 3.2 Option 2: Forking the Repository (For a Personal Starting Point)
   
This option is suitable **if you simply want a copy of the vault** as a starting point for your *own* personal vault and **do not** intend to regularly sync with my future updates.
   
1.  **Fork the repository:** Go to `https://github.com/sagieinav/obsidian-cs-knowledge-base.git` on GitHub and click the "Fork" button. This creates a complete copy under your own GitHub account.
   
2.  **Clone *your* forked repository:** Clone the repository from *your* GitHub account URL.
       ```
       git clone <your_forked_repo_url> <destination-folder>
       cd <destination-folder>
       ```
       Replace `<your_forked_repo_url>` with the URL of *your* forked repository.
   
3.  **Open the Vault in Obsidian:**
       Launch Obsidian, click "Open folder as vault", and select the `<destination-folder>`. You may need to enable community plugins.
   
4.  **Use it as your personal vault:** You can now freely add, modify, and delete notes. Since this is your independent copy, you can commit and push changes to *your* remote repository (`origin` by default) without affecting my original one.
   
   **Note:** If you use this method, your fork is independent. Future updates I make to the original repository will **not** automatically appear in your forked copy. This method is simpler if you just want the content as a one-time download and starting point.

## 4 Vault Usage: Tips & Tricks
Here are some tips for using this vault and maximizing workflow: {to be added}
### 4.1 Most Useful Hotkeys
**Note:** The hotkeys in this section are written for MacOS keyboard layout, but they work the same for Windows, with the corresponding keys (‚åò = Ctrl, ‚å• = Alt, etc...)

These are some of the most useful and must-know hotkeys. You can see all hotkeys inside the app (Settings > Hotkeys)

- Open Command Palette: ‚åò + P
- Pin/unpin current tab: ‚å• + P
- Toggle edit/view mode: ‚åò + E
- Export to PDF: ‚åò + Shift + E
- Text formatting: same as any other app. ‚åò + B for **bold**, ‚åò + H for ==highlight==, etc...
